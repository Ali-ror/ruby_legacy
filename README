Device install notes:
===============================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Setup default url options for your specific environment. Here is an
     example of development environment:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     This is a required Rails configuration. In production it must be the
     actual host of your application

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root :to => "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

===============================================================================
Getting Started with RelyLocal Application
===============================================================================
1. run 'rake db:migrate'
2. run 'rake db:seed' to create a global admin
3. Email address and Password will output in console you can use that to log in
4. Startup app and add "/admin" to get the login screen

===============================================================================

===============================================================================
Spork based testing
===============================================================================
As spork is now a git project based gem, to run spork, call:
bundle exec spork
Them in another terminal, run any rspec command:
rspec spec # for the entire test suite
rspec spec/acceptance/banner_feature_spec.rb # for one test scenario
===============================================================================


===============================================================================
Development with Steak
===============================================================================

Steak is a think layer on top of Rspec for faster integration testing from a
development perspective. 

  * To run only unit test and no acceptance testing
    run command: 'rake spec:unit'

  * To run only acceptance test only
    run command: 'rake spec:acceptance'

The rest of the spec commands should work fine with Steak. Autotest also works as
well.
